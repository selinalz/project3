      This webpage is a collection of skies. To interact with the collection, you can click on the different photographs on the page. The ultimate goal is to find all the 'blue skies' and remove all the polluted skies. You can also click on 'new sky' to generate a new location. <br> <span class="sub"> <strong> BLUE </strong> = NO AIR POLLUTION | <strong> BLACK </strong> = AIR POLLUTION </span>
      <br> <br> <br> <span class="sub2"> You will realize that even if you go to a ‘new sky’, air pollution will still exist. We only have one Earth, one sky and it is our duty to keep it ‘blue’. </span>

    <div class="title2"> What does it mean? </div>
    <div class="text2"> <strong> IS YOUR SKY BLUE </strong> is a commentary on air pollution. Statistics show that exposure to air pollution will directly impact our health which can lead to serious consequences. A direct way to measure air pollution is seeing whether or not the sky is blue. Blue sky thinking is then an incentive for us to reduce air pollution and keep our sky blue. This collection therefore encourages viewers to evaluate their lifestyle choices and commit to reducing air pollution so our Earth can become a better place.
